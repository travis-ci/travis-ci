+ travis-ci: add additional worker status infos to json
+ travis-ci: display the current build in the client
+ travis-core: all config jobs get pushed to builds.common. use a builds.config queue instead that is shared by all workers

+ travis-hub: improve logging for async/notification stuff
+ travis-core: add an archive notification that pushes builds to an external json db on build:finished
+ travis-support: move all core_ext to travis-support

- travis-ci: actually archive builds

- travis-ci: add tests for github login that protect against changes in oauth etc

- fix webhook notifications!! (notify @ddollar)

+ port small stuff like the sidebar toggle

- add tests for controller layer
- add acceptance tests
- add service hook specs
- test task/script to add some workers and jobs to a local redis
- load json fixtures generated from real server/app data
- make tests run on travis-ci.org!

== Statemachine

+ move Worker to Notification:Worker

+ spec Pusher notifications
+ go through all models and add pending specs
+ go through all specs and do some cleanup
+ add TestsController
+ add Pusher notification specs for actual messages sent

+ add data migrations
+ fix n+1 queries: https://gist.github.com/058e40dc43b3eb5ac64c

- the worker doesn't seem to notify about task:configure:started
- calculate build duration from matrix.sum(&:duration) or similar

- later: make payload instances Hashrs and rewrite lib/github

# Api changes

- client: use task route for looking up child builds
- client: for configure jobs show "?" instead of a build number
- config: change queues configuration section
