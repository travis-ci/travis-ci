fix branches config
let's be less noisy here
exclude master branch
do not exclude the master branch
Merge branch 'master' of github.com:travis-ci/test-project-1
fake a failing branch
point status images to staging (even though we don't have ssl enabled there)
try to exclude something
test
enable email notification
output the current env so we can see what's going on
disable notifications
Spec examples: publishing of mandatory messages
added updated travis
simplify the matrix a bit
add a git source to the gemfile
remove config
let's send out notifications
don't use bundler_args: --local
Ignore this
change from yajl to multi_json so users can choose the json lib themselves
remove ree
let's add some rubies
set travis notifications
Merge branch 'master' of github.com:ifesdjeen/travis-ci
Test against REE again
Spec example for headers exchange routing
send out notifications
Bump version to 1.4.1
bumped multi_json dependency and yajl dev dep
ignore .rbc files
don't use 1.8.6 and 1.9.1 as they're not installed
This fixes an issue when bundling to a local path (eg. /vendor/bundle).\n\nIf you bundle to a local path bundler is not included in it, so\ncalling \"gem 'bundler'\" will fail.
Don't install gems in the development group for CI
disable notifications and remove jruby
Be sure request.format is not nil (only reproducible in Rails < 3.0.4).
only use 1.9.2 for now
use all rubies again
add 1.8.7
Now that we instructed bundler to install gems --without development, we can test against ruby-head
add rubies
add .travis.yml, disable notifications
use before_script in .travis.yml
simplify rvms and disable notifications
re-add ree
Working With Exchanges doc guide update: headers exchanges
remove jruby
try making things more programmitical so we can more easily run a matrix
remove ree, rcov doesn't work on ree
Revert \"Trigger a CI build\"\n\nThis reverts commit e42438227162a1c3ecae5f54fc081b1807379b1d.
simplify .travis.yml and disable notifications
simplify rvms and disable notifications
Edited .travis.yml via GitHub
disable notifications and remove rbx because it's currently red
Merge remote-tracking branch 'amqp/master'
remove 1.8.6 and 1.9.2 because they're currently red
Update Gemfile to use rake 0.8.7\n\nrake 0.9.x won't be compatible with Cucumber::Rake::Task::ForkedCucumberRunner which uses the RUBY constant, resulting in 'uninitialized constant Cucumber::Rake::Task::ForkedCucumberRunner::RUBY'
fixed tests
Merge branch 'master' of github.com:travis-ci/amq-client into for_travis
Merge branch 'for_travis' of github.com:travis-ci/amqp into for_travis
added unsupported version
Make before_build script executable
colorize section heading and fix exit codes
Do not test against ruby-head, seems to have issues \\w EventMachine 0.12.10 (but not 1.0.b3) on Linux/AMD64
Adding missing line to rakefile
Give slow CI VM more time
add a Gemfile\n\nruby-warrior requires rspec and cucumber for testing
ok, we also need rake
removed unsupported services
apparently rspec needs to be ~> 1.3.x
Lets try adding cool.io to the :test group for CI
try an isolated true/false matrix
Update Gemfile to use rake 0.8.7\\n\\nrake 0.9.x won't be compatible with Cucumber::Rake::Task::ForkedCucumberRunner which uses the RUBY constant, resulting in 'uninitialized constant Cucumber::Rake::Task::ForkedCucumberRunner::RUBY'
revert matrix simplification
Test against 1.8.7-p174, too
ok, mocha is also required
add a Gemfile\n\nruby-warrior is using these dependencies for tests, so at least testing on travis-ci will require this
lets see if this works
relock bundle
Merge pull request #1938 from joefiorini/master\n\nMake to_json take a parameter to exclude root
add rake to the gemspec as it's being used for tests
add rake to the Gemfile
travis
add ivar and gc patches
add rspec to the Gemfile
fix merge
reduce the matrix to 2x5 builds
don't install ruby-debug19 on travis, linecache19 is taking forever and probably even blocks
Fix the README again
Missing templates and json file for repository tests.
Switch to AMQP::IntAllocator for channel id allocation, closes #83\n\nFor very long running apps that open and close channels aggressively, previous implementation\nthat used monotonically growing number did not work very well. IntAllocator takes released\nidentifiers into account (we currently release when channel is closed and on TCP connection\ninterruption).\n\nIt is a loose port of com.rabbitmq.utilities.IntAllocator on top of\njava.util.BitSet. Not as efficient as the RabbitMQ Java client implementation\nbut is good enough for most cases.\n\nAs soon as we implement AMQP::BitSet#next_set_bit (in Java implementation it\nrelies on java.lang.Long.numberOfTrailingZeros), Java client implementation\ncan be ported basically 1-to-1.\n\nSquashed commit of the following:\n\ncommit 9466f7fe81c2371298e2833f15c44f588e27339b\nAuthor: Michael S.
