- Why did you name the configuration file .travis.yml? Why did you not pick Travisfile?

- I want to sponsor a worker machine for Travis CI! Do you want it?

That is awesome, thank you! :)

We are getting swamped with worker machines, so we might not need it ... and we are not going to take machines (and responsibility for maintenance) unless we really need them. But on the other hand we are constantly adding new languages, repositories and load to the system, so maybe we currently are looking for another machine.

Your best bet is to jump into #travis on irc.freenode.net and ask Josh about it. Or you can tweet (@joshkalderimis) or send him an email (...).

Here are our requirements for worker machines:

We are looking for machines that are identical or at least very similar to the machines we have (link to hetzner) and we do need full root access to them as we need to maintain them.
