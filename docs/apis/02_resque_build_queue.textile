The build queue contains jobs that have a meta_id and carry the build data as JSON:

This is how an incoming Resque job is logged to stdout by the worker. The hash is the meta_id:

<pre>
got: (Job{builds} | Travis::Builder | ["54169ca7b2dfc5a4037eb6f52a7fffa4399e5fc0", { ... }])
</pre>

The JSON data looks like this:

<pre>
{
  "number" => 1,
  "committed_at" => "2011-03-06T11:25:48Z",
  "repository" => {
    "name" => "svenfuchs/gem-release",
    "last_duration" => nil,
    "url" => "https://github.com/svenfuchs/gem-release",
    "id" => 8
  },
  "commit" => "8f0daa714530956a44197f1effe924b332241244",
  "config" => { "rvm" => "1.8.7" },
  "committer_name" => "Sven Fuchs",
  "author_name" => "Sven Fuchs",
