Resque will create a Buildable using the build JSON data from the job and call @run!@ on it.

The Buildable will clone the repository from Github and look for a config file.

If the build does not have an env yet (TODO should probably depend on parent_id here) AND it has configurable keys set in the .travis.yml config file from the repo THEN it sets this configuration to the build data and pushes it back to the app. OTHERWISE it will start the build script.

# travis.yml
script: rake ci
env: "FOO=bar"
rvm:
  - 1.8.7
  - 1.9.2
gemfile:
  - ci/Gemfile.rails-2.3.x
  - ci/Gemfile.rails-3.0.x
exclude:
  -
    rvm: 1.8.7
    gemfile: ci/Gemfile.rails.2.3.x
